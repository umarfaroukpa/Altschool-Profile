           <div id="text"> Education is key to learning and knowing so much about the world, but
            just as important, knowing and learning about yourself. We all need
            love and support and learning how to code is my most profound tool to fashion
            my live in order to achieve my goal. learning is the foundation
            from which one can learn and choose an area of expertise, follow one’s
            specific dream, and provide inspiration to others, and in doing so,
            build community. learning is an intense manner of acquiring so many
            skills in a relatively short period of time, and gives me so many
            abilities to cope with life and its challenges. These coding skills and
            abilities are more important than ever in my quickly changing world.
            Do not be left behind or lost; find your place with learning.</div>
